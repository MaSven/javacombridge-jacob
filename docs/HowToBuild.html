<H1>Development Environment</h1>
The simplest installation involves MS Visual C++ 6.0, Eclipse 3.1 and JDK 1.4.
In that situation, you would just create the <i>compilation_tools.properties</i>
using the example build.xml as a template.  All of the releases, up through 1.11, 
were built using Visual C++ 6.0.
<UL>
<li>	Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and it's included library. (to D:\apps in my case)
<li>	Eclipse 3.1 or later from www.eclipse.org.
<li>	Java JDK 1.4 (this was built using 1.4.2.09)
</ul>

Compilation using JDK 1.5 has not been tested
<H1>Build Process</H1>
The build process is based on ANT.  It cannot be built using MAKE.
You can run ANT from inside of eclipse or from the command line.
The ant process is driven off of a configuration file named
<i>compilation_tools.properties</i> that describes the locations of the JDK and Microsoft
C++ tools.  The build.xml file in the root directory contains examples of the contents
of this file.

<p>
There are two main ant targets.
<UL>
<li>"default" executes the following steps when using the default target.
	<UL>
	<li>	Build the Java code
	<li>	Build the jni code
	<li>	create the dll
	<li>	create jar file
	</UL>
<li>"package" runs the above listed steps and then
 
	<UL>
	<LI>builds the javadoc 
	<LI>builds a source zip
	<li>builds a binary zip with the javadoc
	</UL>
</UL>
<p>
<H1>Eclipse Java IDE</h1>
<p>
Eclipse users have to do some minor tweaks to their project if they 
want to use the integrated build process.  This is because the unit
tests are files located in the "unittest" directory while
the project source files themselves are in "src" the root directory.
By default, eclipse will add the entire project as source.  This
messes up the package naming.  A couple small tweaks to the build path
fix this problem.
<ul>

<li>	Eclipse automatically adds the whole project as a source directory
<li>	Remove the root of the project from the build path
<li>	Add folders samples, src and unittest to the build path
<li>	Exclude *.txt from each of the newly added folders.  
</ul>

<h1> Repository Organization </h1>
<p>
Unpack the source archive zip file or check the files out of CVS into d:\jacob 
or some other familiar place.  Source Java and JNI files are located in seperate
packages from the unit tests and the samples.
<p>
The java code is in .\src.<BR>
The C++ code is in .\jni.
<p>
The Servlet examples that required j2ee libraries to compile have temporarily
been removed.
<p>
<h1> 64 bit build support </h1>
<p>
<B>64 bit builds are not supported at this time</b>
<p>
A 64 bit build would involve:
<UL>
<li>	Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and it's included library. (installed in D:\apps in my case)
<li>	Microsoft SDK 2005R2 with the following components
	<ul>
	<li>Windows Core SDK
	<li>Microsoft Web Workshop (IE) SDK is required because it is referenced in atlbase.h
	<li>(optional) Some folks also install the Debugging tools.
	</ul>

<li>	Eclipse 3.1 or later from www.eclipse.org.
<li>	Java JDK 1.4 (this was built using 1.4.2.09)
</ul>
