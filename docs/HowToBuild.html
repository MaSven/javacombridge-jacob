<H1>Development Environment</h1>
The simplest installation involves MS Visual C++ 6.0, Eclipse 3.1 and JDK 1.4.
In that situation, you would just create the <i>compilation_tools.properties</i>
using the example build.xml as a template.  All of the releases, up through 1.11, 
were built using Visual C++ 6.0.
<UL>
<li>	Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and it's included library. (to D:\apps in my case)
<li>	Eclipse 3.1 or later from www.eclipse.org.
<li>	Java JDK 1.4 (this was built using 1.4.2.09)
</ul>

<p>
A more complicated set up would involve:
<UL>
<li>	Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Express, available from the MS web site.<BR>
	if you get an <b>mspdb80.dll not found</b> then you didn't set the environment variables
	%PATH% during the install. You can either add the Common\IDE directory to your path in
	the EnvironmentVariables configuration panel or you can do a quick hack (like I did).
	You can just copy Common7\IDE\*.dll to VC\bin.
<li>	Microsoft SDK with the following components
	<ul>
	<li>Windows Core SDK
	<li>Microsoft Web Workshop (IE) SDK is required because it is referenced in atlbase.h
	<li>(optional) Some folks also install the Debugging tools.
	</ul>

<li>	Eclipse 3.1 or later from www.eclipse.org.
<li>	Java JDK 1.4 (this was built using 1.4.2.09)
</ul>
Compilation using JDK 1.5 has not been tested
<H1>Build Process</H1>
This project has been converted completely from MAKE to ANT.  You can
run ANT from inside of eclipse or from the command line.
The ant process is driven off of a configuration file named
<i>compilation_tools.properties</i> that describes the locations of the JDK and Microsoft
C++ tools.  The build.xml file in the root directory contains examples of the contents
of this file.

<p>
Running ANT via build.xml will do the following with the default target.
<UL>
<li>	Build the Java code
<li>	Build the jni code
<li>	create the dll
<li>	create jar file
</UL>

Running the "package" ANT target runs the above listed steps and then
builds the javadoc and then the zip files.
<p>
<H1>Eclipse Java IDE</h1>
<p>
Eclipse users will have to do some minor tweaks to their project if they 
want to use the integrated build process.  This is because the unit
tests are files located in the "unittest" directory while
the project source files themselves are in "src" the root directory.
<ul>

<li>	Eclipse automatically adds the whole project as a source directory
<li>	Remove the root of the project from the build path
<li>	Add folders samples, src and unittest to the build path
<li>	Exclude *.txt from each of the newly added folders.  
</ul>

<h1> Repository Organization </h1>
<p>
Unpack the source archive or check the files out of CVS into d:\jacob 
<p>
The java code is in .\src.<BR>
The C++ code is in .\jni.
<p>
The Servlet examples that required j2ee libraries to compile have temporarily
been removed.
