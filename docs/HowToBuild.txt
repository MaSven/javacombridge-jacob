To build and run:

Unpack the source archive or check the files out of CVS into d:\jacob 

Install the following tools
	Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, free from Microsoft on their web site.
	Eclipse from www.eclipse.org.
	Java JDK 1.4 (this was built using 1.4.2.09)

	
This project has been converted completely from MAKE to ANT.  You can
run ANT from inside of eclipse or from the command line.
The ant process is driven off of a configuration file named
compilation_tools.properties that describes the locations of the JDK and Microsoft
C++ tools.  Instructions on the information required
in that file are contained in build.xml in the root directory.

The following configuration used by the development team 
using VC++ 6.0 installed in D:\apps:
		JDK=d:/j2sdk1.4.2_09
		MSDEVDIR=d:\\apps\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\VC98
		version=1.11-pre1

Running ANT via build.xml will do the following with the default target.
	Build the Java code
	Build the jni code
	create the dll
	create jar file

Running the "package" ANT target runs the above listed steps and then
builds the javadoc and then the zip files.

ECLIPSE

Eclipse users will have to do some minor tweaks to their project if they 
want to use the integrated build process.  This is because the unit
tests are files located in the "unittest" directory while
the project source files themselves are in "src" the root directory.
	Eclipse automatically adds the whole project as a source directory
	Remove the root of the project from the build path
	Add folders samples, src and unittest to the build path
	Exclude *.txt from each of the newly added folders.  
	
The Servlet examples that required j2ee libraries to compile have temporarily
been removed.

The java code is in .\src.
The C++ code is in .\jni.
