<h1> The Jacob DLL </h1>
<p>
Jacob.jar relies on a DLL file that it loads off of the library path or classpath.  
The code is written so that the jacob.dll is only loaded one time per classloader.
This works fine in the standard application but can cause problems if jacob.jar
is loaded from more than one class loader as in the situation where multiple
jacob dependent web applications run in the same web server.
Jacob is put in the WEB-INF/lib directory of each application's war file.
In this situation, the web server uses a different classloader for each applicaiton.
This means that each application will attempt to load the jacob.dll and errors
are generated.  The only way around this at this time (1.11) is to put the jacob.jar
in the common/lib because that classloader is inherited by all of the applicaitons
so the DLLs will only get loaded once.  (This problem is described in SF 1645463)

<h1>Jacob Command Line Settings</h1>
This library supports several different :
	<h3>java.library.path</h3>
	Used to add the location of the jacob dll to the JVM's library path.
	<p>
	Example: -Djava.library.path=d:/jacob/release/x86 

	<h3>com.jacob.autogc </h3>
	Determines if automatic garbage collection is enabled.  This is the
	only way to free up objects created in event callbacks.  This
	feature is not fully debugged.  
	<p>
	The default value is <strong>false</strong>
	<p>
	Example: -Dcom.jacob.autogc=false 
	
	<h3>com.jacob.debug</h3>
	Determines if debug output is enabled to standard out.
	The default value is <strong>false</strong>
	<p>
	Example: -Dcom.jacob.debug=false
	
	<h3>-XCheck:jni</h3>
	This turns on additional JVM checking for JNI issues.  This is
	not strictly a JACOB system property.
	<p>
	The default is "no additional checking"
	Example: -XCheck:jni
