 * @version $Id$
 * @author joe
 * 
 * DispatchEvents wraps this class around any event handlers
 * before making the JNI call that sets up the link with EventProxy.
 * This means that EventProxy.cpp just calls invoke(String,Variant[])
 * against the instance of this class.  Then this class does 
 * reflection against the event listener to call the actual event methods.
 * All Event methods have the signature
 *  
 * 		<code> void eventMethodName(Variant[])</code>
 * or
 * 		<code> Variant eventMethodName(Variant[])</code>
 *  The void returning signature is the standard legacy signature.
 *  The Variant returning signature was added in 1.10 to support event handlers
 *  returning values.
